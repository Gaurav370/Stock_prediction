#Stock Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project explores various machine learning and deep learning techniques to forecast stock market performance using historical financial data, technical indicators, and sentiment analysis. It was developed as part of the M.Tech Dissertation at BITS Pilani.

🔍 Objective
Analyze historical stock data to uncover key patterns and drivers of stock performance.

Design and implement ML/DL models to predict future stock price movements.

Evaluate and compare traditional statistical models with modern ML/DL techniques.

Optimize models for accuracy and robustness in real-world scenarios.

Test predictions against real stock market data.

🧠 Models Used
ARIMA – For traditional time-series forecasting.

Machine Learning Models – Decision Trees, SVMs, Random Forests.

Deep Learning Models – LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks.

⚙️ Key Features
📊 Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, outlier detection, and feature selection.

📈 Technical Indicators: Moving Averages (SMA, EMA), Momentum Oscillators.

🗞️ Sentiment Analysis: Integration of news and social media signals.

🔄 Model Optimization: Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization.

✅ Model Evaluation: RMSE, MSE, R² Score, and Cross-Validation.

🧪 Results
LSTM models showed superior performance in capturing long-term trends.

ARIMA performed better on short-term but failed on long-term predictions.

Proper data preprocessing and feature engineering significantly boosted model accuracy.

Combining technical indicators with macroeconomic and sentiment data yielded best results.
