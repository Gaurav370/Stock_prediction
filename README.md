Stock market performance prediction has been an area with much research interest from investors and analysts, as well as financial institutions. This is because accurate stock price forecasting offers many rewards, such as better investment strategies and better risk management. This dissertation analyses whether stock performance can be predicted through various techniques and models including traditional financial indicators, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning approaches.
The study discusses the complexity of the stock market, which can be attributed to the economic data, corporate performance, investors' sentiments, and several macroeconomic events underlying the movement of stock prices in the stock market. The review of existing prediction models with their strengths and limitations, so such student will focus using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms in predicting stock prices. The aim here is to analyze and compare how effective these advanced methods are in the prediction of the trends in the stock market and whether these models outperform the traditional statistical methods.
The research collects data from several sources, including the historical stock prices information, the financial reports, the news sentiment, and most of the economic indicators. Various types of pre- processes including normalization, outlier detection, and feature selection are applied to make handling the raw data. The study has several machine learning techniques such as decision trees, support vector machines, random forest classifiers, and neural networks incorporated into it. A more advanced machine learning technique that is used in this work comes in the form of long short-term memory, given its effectiveness in modelling temporal data characteristics, enabling it to capture more sequential events in stock analysis and behavior.
Model evaluation is done through a variety of metrics like accuracy, mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared, with cross-validation being used to validate generalization of the models. The results reflect that deep learning models, particularly those of LSTM, often perform at a very high rate in predicting the price trends of stocks as compared to other traditional machine learning models. It also states how significant it is to apply sentiment analysis that relates to news articles and social media data as among key price-moving inputs.
Beyond performance of the model, the thesis addresses notions of feature engineering: Selection of input variables and impact on prediction accuracy. A key finding is that while technical indicators like moving averages and momentum oscillators are useful, their
